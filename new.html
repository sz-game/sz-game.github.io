<h2>üí° PRO TIPS</h2>

<p><span class="emoji-large">üéØ</span><strong>Beginner Strategy:</strong> Start by focusing on basic obstacle avoidance rather than coin collection. Learn the rhythm of jumping and sliding before attempting advanced maneuvers. Practice lane switching in safe areas to build muscle memory for emergency situations.</p>

<p><span class="emoji-large">üèÜ</span><strong>Advanced Techniques:</strong> Master the double-jump timing for complex obstacle combinations. Use the down key to perform rolls under objects - this technique is crucial for maintaining speed through tight spaces. Chain movements smoothly for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="emoji-large">üí°</span><strong>Secret Coin Farming:</strong> Prioritize collecting coins during easier sections to maximize upgrade potential. Some obstacles hide bonus coin trails - look for alternative paths that offer risk-reward opportunities for experienced players.</p>

<p><span class="emoji-large">‚ö°</span><strong>Speed Optimization:</strong> Maintain momentum by minimizing unnecessary movements. Plan your route 2-3 obstacles ahead and execute precise inputs. Hold your finger on the right side for long jumps when covering larger gaps.</p>

<p><span class="emoji-large">üõ°Ô∏è</span><strong>Survival Mastery:</strong> Focus on consistent performance over risky coin grabs. Build your upgrade foundation through steady, safe runs before attempting high-risk, high-reward strategies for maximum longevity.</p>

<h2>üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics & Strategy</h2>

<p>Stickman Running features a simple endless running game where you run down any of 3 different lanes. The core mechanics revolve around timing-based obstacle avoidance, where players must react quickly to oncoming barriers, spikes, and gaps. The three-lane system provides strategic depth, as players must constantly evaluate which lane offers the safest passage.</p>

<p>The endless runner format ensures that no two runs are identical, with procedurally generated obstacles creating fresh challenges. The dynamic gameplay ensures that each run is unique, offering new challenges and experiences. As progression increases, obstacle density and speed ramp up, demanding faster reflexes and better pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Character progression adds a persistent advancement system where upgrade your Stickman with every Run and unlock unique Skills. This creates a compelling loop where each attempt contributes to long-term character development, encouraging repeated play sessions.</p>

<p>The monetization model focuses on cosmetic upgrades and convenience features rather than pay-to-win mechanics. With the Runner Coins you can unlock new cosmetic Items in the Shop and equip your Stickman, allowing players to personalize their experience while maintaining competitive balance.</p>
